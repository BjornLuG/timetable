  # Timetable

  A timetable for personal use
</div>

## Features

- Progressive Web App (PWA)
- Data are saved locally, no sign-ups required
- No IE support

## Todo

- [ ] Switch to [VeeValidate](https://logaretm.github.io/vee-validate/). Now, [VueFormulate](https://vueformulate.com/) provides components which can't be resolved during compile time, meaning it loads all of its component and is unable to be tree-shaken.
- [ ] Better inputs, especially autocomplete inputs.
- [ ] Better PWA look on mobile devices.
