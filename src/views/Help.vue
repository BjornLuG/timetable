      This is a side project to keep track of the current class. My uni
      generates awful timetable images so I decided to create this app to
      simplify it.

      All data are stored locally. No sign-ups needed. Just don't delete local
      storage.

      <strong>Why not some other full-featured apps?</strong> I wanted to
      actually build something for a problem I have because I often gave up on
      some side projects.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg leading-normal my-3">
      <strong>Is this usable?</strong> Yes, and no. It works for me, but they're
      many edge cases that I didn't bother to look into because it's something I
      would never encounter. It is intended for personal use after all :)
